    content:
      "Friar Anselmo (God's grace may he win!)\nCommitted one sad day a deadly sin;\n\nWhich being done he drew back, self-abhorred,\nFrom the rebuking presence of the Lord,\n\nAnd, kneeling down, besought, with bitter cry,\nSince life was worthless grown, that he might die.\n\nAll night he knelt, and, when the morning broke,\nIn patience still he waits death's fatal stroke.\n\nWhen all at once a cry of sharp distress\nAroused Anselmo from his wretchedness;\n\nAnd, looking from the convent window high,\nHe saw a wounded traveller gasping lie\n\nJust underneath, who, bruised and stricken sore,\nHad crawled for aid unto the convent door.\n\nThe friar's heart with deep compassion stirred,\nWhen the poor wretch's groans for help were heard\n\nWith gentle hands, and touched with love divine,\nHe bathed his wounds, and poured in oil and wine.\n\nWith tender foresight cared for all his needs,-\nA blessed ministry of noble deeds.\n\nIn such devotion passed seven days. At length\nThe poor wayfarer gained his wonted strength.\n\nWith grateful thanks he left the convent walls,\nAnd once again on death Anselmo calls.\n\nWhen, lo! his cell was filled with sudden light,\nAnd on the wall he saw an angel write,\n\n(An angel in whose likeness he could trace,\nMore noble grown, the traveller's form and face),\n\n'Courage, Anselmo, though thy sin be great,\nGod grants thee life that thou may'st expiate.\n\n'Thy guilty stains shall be washed white again,\nBy noble service done thy fellow-men.\n\n'His soul draws nearest unto God above,\nWho to his brother ministers in love.'\n\nMeekly Anselmo rose, and, after prayer,\nHis soul was lightened of its past despair.\n\nHenceforth he strove, obeying God's high will,\nHis heaven-appointed mission to fulfil.\n\nAnd many a soul, oppressed with pain and grief,\nOwed to the friar solace and relief.",

      "Old man Smith has a sign that says not to trespass.\nI crawled under his barbwire fence and it pricked my ass.\nThat darn fence also ripped off my pants.\nMy legs got covered with about two hundred ants.\n\nThey climbed up my underwear and started biting my ass.\nThey all ran to the ground when I passed gas.\nI turned around and saw Old man Smith's bull.\nI started running because I'm no fool.\n\nThe bull chased me and used its horns to tear off my underwear.\nI finally got away but I was embarrassed and scared.\nI needed to get home without being seen.\nBut an old lady fainted when she saw me.\n\nBeing seen naked was something I was trying to prevent.\nWhen that old lady saw me, I nearly died of embarrassment.\nRunning from that bull was very intense.\nThat's the last time I'll crawl under a barbwire fence.",

Thy purpose see;\nYet all is well-since ruled by Thee.\nWhen, mounted on Thy clouded car,\nThou send'st Thy darker spirits down,\nI can discern Thy light afar,\nThy light, sweet beaming through Thy frown;\nAnd should I faint a moment-then\nI think of Thee,-and smile again.\nSo, trusting in Thy love, I tread\nThe narrow path of duty on;\nWhat though some cherished joys are fled?\nWhat though some flattering dreams are gone?\nYet purer, brighter joys remain;\nWhy should my spirit, then, complain?",

I see the old sunshine\nUpon the moss, thick strewn with fir and pine;\nThe open field; the orchard’s even rows;\nThe wood again; then, where the hills unclose,\nFar off at first, now near, the long-sought shrine.\nO Time, how impotent thou art! Though thou\nHast taken me from all things, and all things\nFrom me,—although the wind of thy swift wings\nHath swept at last the shadow from her brow\nOf my last kiss, yet do I triumph now\nWho, choosing, paused to hear Love’s counsellings.",

Brave idolatry \nWhich can conceive a hero! No deceit, \nNo knowledge taught by unrelenting years, \nCan quench this fierce, untamable desire. \nWe know that what we long for once achieved \nWill cease to satisfy. Be still our fears; \nIf what we worship fail us, still the fire \nBurns on, and it is much to have believed.",
